Project Statement

📌 Project Title

Medicine Reminder & Tracker System

📖 Problem Statement

Many people—especially elderly individuals, patients with chronic illnesses, and busy students—often forget to take their medicines on time. Missing dosages can lead to reduced treatment effectiveness and health complications. Traditional reminder methods (like manual notes, alarms, or verbal reminders) are unreliable and lack proper tracking.

There is a need for a simple, beginner‑friendly system that:

Stores medicine information

Reminds the user at the correct time

Tracks whether the medicine was taken or missed


This project provides a basic Python‑based solution to address these issues using file storage instead of a database.

🎯 Scope of the Project

The scope of this project includes:

Building a menu-driven Python application

Allowing users to add medicines with dosage and time

Viewing all saved medicines

Marking medicines as taken

Providing time-based reminders

Storing all data in a JSON file

Ensuring a simple and beginner-appropriate implementation


The project does not include database integration, advanced scheduling, mobile notifications, or GUI development. It remains within the boundaries of introductory Python concepts.

👥 Target Users

This system is designed for:

Students

Elderly individuals

Patients with daily or frequent medication schedules

Anyone who needs simple medicine tracking and reminders


🚀 High-Level Features

Medicine Management: Add, view, update status

Reminder System: Alerts the user when it's time to take a medicine

File-Based Storage: JSON format for data persistence

Simple Menu Interface: Easy for beginners to operate

Tracking Feature: Mark medicine as "taken" for the day
